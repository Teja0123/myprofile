      <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m K. Naga Venkata Teja, a passionate Web & App Developer with a strong interest in creating user-friendly and functional applications. Currently pursuing my BTech (3rd year) at Aditya Engineering College, I specialize in front-end and back-end development, focusing on building modern, efficient, and engaging digital solutions.

I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, and backend technologies, enabling me to develop full-stack applications. My journey in development has been driven by curiosity and a desire to build meaningful projects like NotifyNation, a platform for job notifications and exam updates.
